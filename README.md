# Scientific Calculator

A scientific calculator app built with Flutter, offering a variety of basic and advanced mathematical functions. The app is designed with a responsive layout to provide an optimized user experience across different screen sizes.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Scientific Functions**: Includes trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithmic functions (log, ln), square root, exponential, and factorial operations.
- **Constants**: Access constants like π (Pi) and e.
- **Rad/Deg Toggle**: Switch between Radian and Degree modes for trigonometric functions.
- **Responsive Design**: A four-button-per-row layout that adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages for invalid operations.

   flutter run
   ```

## Usage

- **Basic Operations**: Use arithmetic buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Scientific Functions**: Access trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`), logarithmic functions (`log`, `ln`), square root (`√`), and exponential functions (`EXP`).
- **Constants**: Use π and e buttons to quickly insert these constants into calculations.
- **Toggle Radian/Degree Mode**: Switch between Rad and Deg modes for trigonometric calculations.
- **Real-time Calculation**: View results instantly as you input values and operators.
